* TODOs
- [ ] Refactor the Category module to expose a "factory".
- [ ] Give an *automated* construction of the identity GraphHom.
- [ ] Give an *automated* construction of the composite of two GraphHoms
      (GraphHom.compose)
- [ ] Prove that there is a category of Graphs.
- [ ] Prove that the category Graph has products.
- [ ] Define a tactic that proves two elements of a
  primitive record type are equal, given that their components are equal.
- [ ] Define the product of two categories / onebicats.
- [ ] Define a bicategory
- [ ] Define notions of LARI and RARI for bicategories
- [ ] Define a (strict) fibration between bicategories
- [ ] Prove that the exponential fibration is a product
- [ ] Create a tactic which inspects a type, and decides whether
  that type is an inductive type or record type fully applied
  to its arguments and parameters. If it is, it returns information such as:
  is it a true inductive type, or is it a primitive record?
  If it is a primitive record, what are its constructors?
- [ ] Create a tactic which is a variant of intros that supports
      primitive records correctly.
- [ ] Expose clearbody in Ltac2.
- [ ] Improve sfirstorder to do intros.
