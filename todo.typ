* TODOs
// - [ ] Create a tactic which inspects a type, and decides whether
//   that type is an inductive type or record type fully applied
//   to its arguments and parameters. If it is, it returns information such as:
//   is it a true inductive type, or is it a primitive record?
//   If it is a primitive record, what are its constructors?
// - [ ] Create a tactic which is a variant of intros that supports
//       primitive records correctly.
- [ ] Define the category of graphs.
- [ ] Define a tactic that proves two elements of a
      primitive record type are equal, given that their components are equal.
- [ ] Define the product of two categories / onebicats.
- [ ] Define a bicategory
- [ ] Define notions of LARI and RARI for bicategories
- [ ] Define a (strict) fibration between bicategories
- [ ] Prove that the exponential fibration is a product
